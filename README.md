## Way of Work
I usually start my projects by creating a repository in GitHub. After thinking of a name and cloning it to my local directory, I commit a single Python file (or edit the pre-made README.md) and push it to verify that everything works fine. Then I create a virtual environment (since I mostly work with Python), update my aliases so I can activate it anytime, and finally boot up PyCharm.  

## CLI Set Up
### `~/.myscripts/`
I store my scripts in this directory. Do not forget to run `chmod -R +x ~/.myscripts`

## Ubuntu Commands
### `apt-get update`
It doesn't actually install new versions of software. Instead, it updates the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well as new packages that have just come to the repositories.  

See: [What does sudo apt-get update do](https://askubuntu.com/questions/222348/what-does-sudo-apt-get-update-do)

### `apt-get upgrade`
Installs the newest versions of all currently installed packages on a system.
